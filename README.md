Making Energy Data Talk:
Exploratory Data Analysis with Python
In this project, I explored the Residential Energy Efficiency Projects dataset to uncover hidden patterns and insights about household upgrades and energy savings for low-income homes.

🔍 Focus Areas:
Identifying top-performing project types and utilities

Analyzing the relationship between project cost and energy savings

Exploring trends across years, dwelling types, and regions

🛠 Tools Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas for data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

🎯 Key Accomplishments:
Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset for better analysis

Compared project costs and savings by utility, county, and dwelling type

Visualized correlations between project cost and estimated energy savings

Extracted insights to support future energy program decisions

📈 Insights Discovered:
Some project types deliver higher energy savings relative to cost

Certain utilities and counties consistently show better project efficiency

Visual storytelling helped highlight trends not obvious from raw data

🧠 Lessons Learned:
This project was about more than just coding — it sharpened my skills in:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Telling a clear business story through data

Designing effective, actionable visualizations
