# Making Sales Data Talk: 

Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

In this project, I explored the **Superstore dataset** to uncover the hidden stories behind sales and profit trends.

## Focus Areas
- Identifying top-performing **categories** and **regions**
- Analyzing the **relationship between sales and profit**
- Exploring **trends** over time and across **product segments**

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations

## Key Accomplishments
- Cleaned and explored the dataset thoroughly
- Performed detailed comparisons by region and category
- Visualized sales vs. profit to identify patterns
- Extracted actionable insights for better decision-making

## Insights Discovered
- Some product categories have **high sales** but **low quantity sold**
- A few regions **consistently outperform** others
- Visual storytelling brings clarity to raw numbers

## Lessons Learned
This project was about more than just coding. It deepened my skills in:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Building business narratives**
- **Effective data visualization**
