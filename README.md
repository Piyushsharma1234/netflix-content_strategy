🚀 Project Title - Netflix Content Strategy 

 *What Makes Streaming Stick? I Asked Python and Got Answers!*

I've always believed content isn’t just what we watch – it’s how platforms shape our tastes. So, I analyzed Netflix data using Python to understand the engine behind its content strategy.

🔍 *What I Explored:*

• What genres dominate in different regions? 
• How does content release frequency affect popularity? 
• Is there a pattern in content type vs. audience engagement?

🔧 *Tools Used:* 
Python | 
Pandas | 
Matplotlib | 
Seaborn 

🏗️ *What I Built:*

• Cleaned and explored the Netflix dataset 
• Analyzed genre trends across countries 
• Visualized release patterns and viewer ratings 
• Uncovered strategic content placement insights 

🈺 *Interesting Finds:* 
• Dramas and documentaries are global hits, but regional preferences vary 
• Netflix ramps up content releases during key viewing periods 
• Originals play a crucial role in viewer retention 

🔑 *Key Takeaway:* 
This wasn’t just a data dive – it was about decoding strategy behind the screen. I sharpened my skills in EDA, storytelling, and pattern recognition in media data.
